### Distributed Systems & Compute Infrastructure

I build protocols that make volatile resources production-ready. My work focuses on intelligent orchestration, fault tolerance, and optimizing the intersection of AI compute and decentralized networks.

**Current Focus:**
*   **[Synkti](https://github.com/bobby-math/synkti)**: Domain-agnostic orchestration for spot instances using Kuhn-Munkres optimal migration and grace-period checkpoint recovery.
*   **Axon**: Distributed neuron execution runtime.
*   **Synapse**: Inter-node communication layer for decentralized inference.

**Core Thesis:**
Compute scarcity is a coordination problem. Stranded inventory (spot instances, consumer GPUs) offers 4-5x capacity expansion if orchestrated with provably optimal scheduling logic.

**Stack:**
*   **Languages:** Rust (primary), C++ (CUDA)
*   **Systems:** Solana, AWS Spot, discrete-event simulation
*   **Interests:** DePIN, Mechanism Design, Control Theory
